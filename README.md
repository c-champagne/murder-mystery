This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This game was created in two weeks with a focus on implementing React and Redux.

Mystery at Sea is a web-based murder mystery type game.  The player can navigate to different areas and speak to the different characters. As the player explores, they will learn clues and open up new locations.  The player should use their own judgement to determine if a character should be considered a “suspect” and add them to their list.  To end the game, the player returns to the office and accuses one of the suspects. Currently, on start up the game will randomly choose one of three characters to be the murderer.

## Code Used

Mystery at Sea uses React and Redux to display a dynamic game screen with multiple interacting parts. The main component handles the routing and acts as a frame for the location image, dialogue boxes, and the controls section on the right.

Each location is a component and is loaded based on the player’s current path.

Each set of character dialogue is a component and these components use local state to allow for changing dialogue and character images.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
